## Learning Vulkan

This repo keeps a record of me trying to figure out the stuff I don't know while
following https://vulkan-tutorial.com/

At the moment of staring the tutorial I have 0 idea of how Vulkan works. And the
bare minimum understanding of C++. So the purpose of this project is learning.
And documenting, so it may be helpful for others :D

## Vulkan app

At the root is the code for the simple vulkan app I am building.

## Notes

I'll add a Notes file with a small note or links to blog posts I wrote about the
things I had to figure out to make it to that point. I'll add an index here.

## Goal

My main goal is to get confortable working with a complex and low level API. As
well as with C++. Of course, I also want to learn Vulkan itself.
